 <p style="text-align:justify;">High-quality single-bead patterns are constructed through the system. Multiple relays are connected to the microchip to individually energize the dot electrodes to generate the electric fields for micro bead (Polystyrene bead) holding and patterning. Optimization patterning strategies are proposed to reduce the time for patterning [1]. In order to prevent more than one bead from being trapped by the same electrode, vision-based algorithms are developed to manipulate the target bead toward the desired position with respect to the electrode such that the redundant beads near the target bead can be repelled by the electric field. To avoid the target bead being influenced by local electric field minima or other electrodes, path planning is incorporated for bead manipulation. A controller is used to guide the microparticles follow the created path [2]. 40um diameter PS bead with a fluorescent color is considered to conduct the experiments. A series of tests are performed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of this system. </p>

Compared to the LOC device, the proposed system offers high flexibility for micropatterning. The movability of the microchip not only increases the working area, but also provides a possibility to be applied with a controller for precise control. Besides, the cost for large numbers of microparticles manipulating and patterning is low. By increasing the number of electrodes, it is easy to construct a high-throughput microparticles pattern. The controllability for the individual electrodes achieves different micropatterns fabrication. The microchip can selectively trap the microparticles for forming different patterns.
