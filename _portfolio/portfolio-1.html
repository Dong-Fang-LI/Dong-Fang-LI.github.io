High-quality single-bead patterns are constructed through the system. Multiple relays are connected to the microchip to energize individual dot-electrodes to generate different electric field forms for micro bead holding and patterning. Optimization patterning strategies are proposed to reduce the time for patterning. Vision-based algorithms are developed to manipulate the target bead toward the desired position with respect to the electrode such that nearby beads can be repelled by the electric field to prevent more than one bead from being trapped by each electrode. A controller is used to guide the microparticles toward the position for trapping while avoiding flow disturbance. PS bead pattern with orange fluorescent color is fabricated [1,3].
