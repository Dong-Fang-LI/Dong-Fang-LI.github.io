<p style="text-align:justify;">Biological yeast cell (8um) cluster patterning is conducted through the system. Cell behavior is investigated under DEP force with different media, voltage inputs for generating electric fields, and voltage frequencies to enhance the performance and efficiency of nDEP patterning [2]. Different cell cluster patterns are formed on the substrate by controlling the opening of each dot electrode on the microchip. By holding the cells in clusters and transferring the microchip, clean cell cluster patterns can be created. In order to form the cell pattern in different substrates, the mechanism for cells to adhere to the substrate is also examined to optimize cell attachment. With the system, we can trap and pattern cells on the surface of any substrate with design forms [1].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Different from the LOC device, the separation between the microchip and the substrate in this system makes it possible to pattern the biological cells to any biocompatible material substrate instead of the glass. The open environment of the system enables cell patterning in a shaped hydrogel substrate as the hydrogel can be picked and manipulated after crosslinking. Moreover, the relative movement between the microchip and the substrate increases the flexibility of the microchip, providing a way to construct a large-scale cell pattern.</p>
