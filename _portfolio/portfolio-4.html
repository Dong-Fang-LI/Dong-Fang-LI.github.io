<p style="text-align:justify;">Equipped with a large-scale quadrupole microchip, the system enables mouse embryo rotation and alignment. The microchip simulation shows that the designed quadrupole electrode microchip can trap and rotate the embryos in the center of the electrodes. vision-based algorithms are developed to acquire necessary information such as, the position and orientation of the embryo relative to the electrodes for precise control.  With this information, the PID controller is applied to the system for precise embryo manipulation. The PID controller is applied to the system for embryo translation and rotation to increase the accuracy of the system. A series of tests is performed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the system.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This system offers a non-contact method for embryo manipulation, avoiding the adhesion force between the embryo and the tool. The controllers applied to the system guarantee the operation accuracy for manipulation. The most important is that, compared with the LOC device, the open environment of the system provides the possibility of further processing after cell manipulation, such as cell injection.</p>
