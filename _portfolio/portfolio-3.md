title: "Large-scale Cell Cluster Patterning with the Proposed System"
excerpt: <p style="text-align:justify;">A large-scale yeast cell pattern is achieved using the moving platform of the microscope. The relative movement between the microchip and the substrate on the platform aids in constructing cell cluster patterns anywhere in the substrate. <br/><img src="/images/large_cell_pattern.png" width="768" height="193.3"></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A large-scale yeast cell pattern is also achieved using the moving platform of the microscope. The relative movement between the microchip and the substrate on the platform aids in constructing cell cluster patterns anywhere in the substrate. Experiments on cell cluster dissipation time are conducted to decrease patterning time and improve performance [1].</p>
