<p style="text-align:justify;">A large-scale yeast cell pattern is also achieved using the moving platform of the microscope. The relative movement between the microchip and the substrate on the platform aids in constructing cell cluster patterns anywhere in the substrate. A series of cell cluster characters are patterned by intermittently energize the specific electrodes while the platform is moving. Experiments on cell cluster dissipation time are conducted to decrease patterning time and improve performance [1].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Different from the LOC device, the separation between the microchip and the substrate in this system makes it possible to pattern the biological cells to any biocompatible material substrate instead of the glass. The open environment of the system enables cell patterning in a shaped hydrogel substrate as the hydrogel can be picked and manipulated after crosslinking. Moreover, the relative movement between the microchip and the substrate increases the flexibility of the microchip, providing a way to construct a large-scale cell pattern.</p>
